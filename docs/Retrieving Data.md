# Retrieving data

This section describes how to maximize the amount of event information available for retrieval by WELM. A truly exhaustive and complete amount of event information will never be able to be retrieved for a number of reasons:
1. Some event information can't be loaded due to errors in their definitions.
1. Some features can't be installed simultaneously in Windows preventing retrieval of associated event information.

## Host system preparation

What you need:

1. A compiled debug or release version of WELM (see [Building WELM](./Building%20WELM.md)).
1. A host system running Windows 10 1607 or later (required for [PowerShell Direct](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/powershell-direct) [persistent session](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/powershell-direct#copy-files-with-new-pssession-and-copy-item) and NAT switch support).
1. Hyper-V installed on the host system.
1. A Hyper-V [NAT switch](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/1irtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/setup-nat-network) if you want the system to access the Internet to install patches from Windows Update.
1.  A .iso file containing installation media for Enterprise Edition (x86 and x64) for desktop systems and Datacenter or Enterprise Edition for server systems.

#### Windows 8.1

Follow the instructions in the [Windows 8](#windows-8) section.

#### Windows 8.1 Update

Follow the instructions in the [Windows 8](#windows-8) section. You will need to rename the output folder to differentiate it from Windows 8.1 without the update. Insert \_u\_ between "8.1" and "enterprise".

#### Windows 10 1507

Follow the instructions in the [Windows 8](#windows-8) section.

#### Windows 10 1511

Follow the instructions in the [Windows 8](#windows-8) section.

#### Windows 10 1607 and later

Starting with Windows 10 1607, the [Automate-WELM.ps1](..\welm\Automate-WELM.ps1) script is provided to automate retrieval of data generated by WELM. The host must be at least Windows 10 1607 with Hyper-V installed and the guest must be Windows 10 1607 or later since the script uses PowerShell Direct ([1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/user_guide/vmsession), [2](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server-docs/compute/hyper-v/manage/manage-windows-virtual-machines-with-powershell-direct)).

Create a template virtual machine that can be cloned by the script. The virtual machine should have Internet access OR a Windows installation DVD inserted into its virtual DVD drive. Run the following command on the host as an administrator:

```
powershell.exe -File "C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\Windows-Event-Log-Messages\welm\Automate-WELM.ps1" -VMNetwork 172.16.0 -VMNetworkPrefixSize 24 -VMName "Windows 10 1607 Enterprise x64" -HostStagingPath "C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\Windows-Event-Log-Messages\welm\dist" -HostResultPath "C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\Windows-Event-Log-Messages\docs\data" -VMStagingPath "C:\transfer\in" -VMResultPath "C:\transfer\out" -HostTranscriptPath "C:\users\user\Desktop" powershell.exe -File "C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\Windows-Event-Log-Messages\welm\Automate-WELM.ps1" -VMNetwork 172.16.0 -VMNetworkPrefixSize 24 -VMName "Windows 10 1607 Enterprise x64" -HostCodePath "C:\users\user\Desktop" -HostStagingPath "C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\Windows-Event-Log-Messages\welm\dist" -HostResultPath "C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\Windows-Event-Log-Messages\docs\data" -VMStagingPath "C:\transfer\in" -VMResultPath "C:\transfer\out" -HostTranscriptPath "C:\users\user\Desktop" -DnsServer '123.45.67.890' -NoWindowsUpdate -Verbose
```

### Servers

#### Windows Server 2003

Same as Windows XP steps. Put junk values in everything when components are installed. Don't install Certificate Services until after running dcpromo because it will ask to uninstall it. Right click on the VM and give it a valid network adapter and connection. This is temporarily required mainly for dcpromo but it helps for IIS too.

If a Windows feature/component is checked but its box is gray rather than white, then that means sub-components are not getting installed. Select the component and click the Details button to enable all the components. Some components that won't be installed:

* Active Directory Services > ADFS >
    * Federation Service - requires dcpromo AND a SSL certificate in IIS
    * Federation Proxy - requires dcpromo AND a SSL certificate in IIS
* Active Directory Services > Indentity Management for UNIX >
    * Server for NIS - requires dcpromo
* Application Server
    * Enable network DTC access - wouldn't install on x86, but did on x64
* Application Server > Message Queuing >
    * Downlevel Client Support - requires running dcpromo... wouldn't install on x86, complained about MSMQ 1.0 being installed. Installed on x64.
    * Routing Support - requires running dcpromo... wouldn't install on x86, complained about MSMQ 1.0 being installed. Installed on x64.

The ADFS service and proxy wouldn't install on x65. On x86 there was a bunch of other components that wouldn't install as outlined above.

Run dcpromo.

Install Certificate Services. Put junk values in everything except the Distinguished Name during CA installation. Use C=test as an example value.

Also install the other parts as mentioned above (Server for NIS, Application Server stuff).

Run welm.bat.

#### Windows Server 2008

Don't install AD CS, AD FS, AD LDS, AD RMS, DNS, DHCP, TS until after installing AD DS and running dcpromo.

On the server it brings up the Roles and Features dialog. Install all the features possible and reboot. There will only be two sub-items that can't install since they need to be installed once domain joined:
* Message Queuing > Message Queuing Services > Routing Service 
* Message Queuing > Windows 2000 Client Support

After running dcpromo and rebooting, install the above features.

1. Install .Net 4.0
1. Install all roles except for Active Directory ones. WSUS won't install from Server Manager. Install WSUS 3.0 SP2 (SP1 is what would normally come with Server 2008 so SP2 is good enough).
1. Install Active Directory Domain Services. Run dcpromo.
1. Install the remaining AD roles (create a user in AD for AD RMS to install and use the server's fqdn as the RMS federation server name and cluster server name).
1. Go back to Add Features and install Message Queuing > Message Queuing Services > Routing Support. The other sub item (Message Queuing > Windows 2000 Client Support) will not install.
1. Run welm.bat.

Insert more complicated steps...

RMS issue: https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/253.the-password-could-not-be-validated-when-attempting-to-provision-an-ad-rms-server.aspx

#### Windows Server 2008 R2

Follow the instructions in the [Windows 8](#windows-8) section.

1. Install .Net 4.0
1. Run Invoke-InstallFeatures twice.
1. Give an IP address.
1. Uninstall Active Directory Certificate Services
1. Run dcpromo
1. Run Invoke-InstallFeatures again to install AD CS.

The OEMHelpCustomization and CorporateHelpCustomization features fail to install with an error of 1603.

Installing Index Server causes some roles and features to not be able to be installed:

* Roles: Application Server, WSUS
* Features: Windows Internal Database

1. Uninstall Indexing Server by typing **dism.exe /online /disable-feature /featurename:Indexing-Service-Package** and pressing **Enter**.
1. Reboot.
1. Install the WSUS role by connecting the system to the internet and installing it through Add Roles or by using the [offline installer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5216). WSUS will install the Windows Internal Database feature.
1. Install the Application Server role and all its sub roles/features.
1. Run Invoke-InstallFeatures again to install the Indexing Service.
1. Run welm.bat.

#### Windows Server 2012
Follow the instructions in the [Windows 8](#windows-8) section.

1. Give the system an IP address.
1. In Server Manager go to **Manage** > **Remove Roles and Features**.
1. Remove AD CS.
1. Reboot **shutdown /r /f /t 0**.
1. In Server Manager select AD DS from the left hand pane.
1. Click **More...** link in the yellow bar on the right hand pane.
1. Click **Promote this server to a domain controller** from under the Action column.
1. Run Invoke-InstallFeatures again to install AD CS.
1. Run welm.bat.

#### Windows Server 2012 R2
Follow the instructions in the [Windows Server 2012](#windows-server-2012) section.

#### Windows Server 2012 R2 Update

Follow the instructions in the [Windows Server 2012 R2](#windows-server-2012-r2) section.

You will need to rename the output folder to differentiate it from Windows Server 2012 R2 without the update. Insert \_u\_ between "R2" and "datacenter".

#### Windows Server 2016

Configure the network. Give the system a static IP address. The IP address and Primary DNS address should be the same. Secondary DNS address should be 127.0.0.1. Set a Gateway address.

Follow the instructions in the [Windows 8](#windows-8) section.

After the initial reboot, open an administrator command prompt, type **shutdown /a** and press Enter.

Run Invoke-InstallFeatures again.

The Server-Gui-mgmt\_onecore feature fails to install with an error code of 50.

There is a bug which prevents setting the gateway after installing all features. Without this, the server can't become a domain controller.
