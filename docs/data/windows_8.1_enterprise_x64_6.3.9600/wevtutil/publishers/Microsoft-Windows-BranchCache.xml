Error: %2 %3 
Possible reasons for this error:
-the client has been configured with an incorrect Hosted Cache server name
-the client has been configured with an incorrect Hosted Cache server port
-the firewall on the Hosted Cache server is blocking communication
-the hosted cache server has not been configured with a certificate trusted by the client
-the client has been configured to use TLS when communicating with the hosted cache, but the hosted cache has not been configured to use TLS
-the client has been configured to not use TLS when communicating with the hosted cache, but the hosted cache has not been configured to expect TLS

The client can be configured by running the &quot;netsh branchcache set service hostedclient location=[HOSTEDSERVER]&quot; command from an elevated prompt.
The Hosted Cache server can be configured by running the &quot;netsh branchcache set service hostedserver&quot; command from an elevated prompt.

For advanced configuration and information about certificate deployment on a Hosted Cache server, please see the BranchCache deployment guide.">
