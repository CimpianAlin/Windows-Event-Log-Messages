Only users with domain administration permissions can add members to the Windows Authorization Access Group, which is allowed access to the TokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal attribute, in one of two ways:
 1) For best security practice, add only the computer accounts that need access to the TokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal attribute to the Windows Authorization Access Group. The domain administrator will repeat this operation for other Message Queuing computers that require the permission, manually adding the relevant accounts to the Windows Authorization Access Group.
 2) As a less secure practice, add the Authenticated Users group to the Windows Authorization Access group.
