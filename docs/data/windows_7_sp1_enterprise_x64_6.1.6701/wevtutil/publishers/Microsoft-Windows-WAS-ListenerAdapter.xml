Cause: Configured Identity for protocol &apos;%1&apos; in applicationHost.config does not match identity of process &apos;%2&apos; hosting Listener Adapter.  Fix: Ensure that the identity for protocol &apos;%1&apos; is configured correctly in applicationHost.config.">

This event will only be logged once.  Cause: This could be caused by either Windows Process Activation Service not being started, the protocol not being configured in &lt;listenerAdapters&gt; section, or another process already connected as Listener Adapter for that protocol.  Fix: Ensure that Windows Process Activation Service is running, the protocol is configured in the &lt;listenerAdapters&gt; section, and that another process has not already connected as the Listener Adapter for that protocol.">
