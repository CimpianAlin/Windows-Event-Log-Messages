# Windows Event Log Messages
The Windows Event Log Messages (WELM) tool retrieves the definitions of Windows Event Log messages embedded in binaries. The tool's output can be used to create an exhaustive list of event information for an operating system. 

The tool was initially developed to aid in writing the [Spotting the Adversary with Windows Event Log Monitoring](https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-guidance/security-configuration/applications/spotting-the-adversary-with-windows-event-log-monitoring.cfm) paper but has proven useful in a number of scenarios:
* Determining if there is an event that captures specific data of interest.
* Diffing event changes between operating system releases.
* Diffing event changes between operating system patch levels (more common in Windows 10).
* Documenting event specific informational fields and their data types which is useful for enriching event collection and analysis systems.
* Determining default states for logs and sources (enabled/disabled, max size, rotation policy, permissions, etc).
* Observing event system changes over time.

## Documentation
For more information see: 
* [Building WELM](./docs/Building%20WELM.md) - how to build WELM
* [Running WELM](./docs/Running%20WELM.md)  -  how to run WELM and generate data
* [Datasets](./docs/Datasets.md) - available data

## Data
Collected data is available in the [data folder](./docs/data) organized by operating system version and architecture. This data will grow over time. Data is described in the [Datasets](./docs/Datasets.md) page.

Most operating system folders contain two folders: **welm** and **wevtutil**. The **welm** folder contains files generated by the WELM tool. The **wevtutil** folder contains files generated by using wevutil to dump all log and publisher information. Most users will be interested in the **events.csv**, **logs.csv**, and **providers.csv** files inside the the welm folder for each operating system.
