# Windows Event Log Messages
The Windows Event Log Messages (WELM) tool retrieves the definitions of Windows Event Log messages embedded in binaries. The tool's output can be used to create an exhaustive list of event information for the operating system. The tool was initially developed to aid in writing the [Spotting the Adversary with Windows Event Log Monitoring](https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-guidance/security-configuration/applications/spotting-the-adversary-with-windows-event-log-monitoring.cfm) paper.

## Documentation
See [Building WELM](.\docs\Building WELM.md) and [Running WELM](.\docs\Running WELM.md) for more information.

## Data
Collected data is available in the [data folder](./docs/data) organized by operating system version and architecture. This data will grow over time. 

Each operating system folder contains two folders: **welm** and **wevtutil**. The **welm** folder contains files generated by the WELM tool. The **wevtutil** folder contains files generated by using wevutil to dump all log and publisher information. Most users will be interested in the **events.csv**, **logs.csv**, and **providers.csv** files inside the operating system folders found under the welm folder.
